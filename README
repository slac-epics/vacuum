This is a module for the vacuum IOCs. Basically I want to have one place to
keep all the templates for the vacuum IOCs used in LCLS. Additionally, this will
help keep everyone's IOC version up-to-date.

To use it on your vacuum IOC make sure you release file looks like this:
###############################################3
# RELEASE
# Defines location of external products
include $(TOP)/RELEASE_SITE

# ===============================================================
# Define the version of our generic vacuum ioc and
# use it's release settings
# ===============================================================
VAC_IOC_VERSION=<version of module you want to use>
include $(EPICS_SITE_TOP)/modules/vacuum/$(VAC_IOC_VERSION)/configure/RELEASE

VACUUM=$(EPICS_SITE_TOP)/modules/vacuum/$(VAC_IOC_VERSION)/
##########################################################

Also, add this line to your ***App/src/Makefile:
iocname_LIBS += vacuum

That should do it!

Now you don't have to keep the .template files for the vacuum devices in your IOC files. They will be sourced from this module,
which will make the vacuum IOC easier to maintain.
